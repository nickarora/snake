## Description
Snake is a clone of the classic 1970s arcade game of the same name (although it is more commonly known from its inclusion on cell phones in recent years).

The player controls a tiny snake on a bordered plane.  As it moves forward, the snake's body trails behind it in a fixed position.  Apples appear on the plane in random position.  Everytime the snake eats an apple, its body grows.  

The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding wtih the borders OR colliding with your own body.

## Technologies Used

It is worth noting that this implementation does not use HTML5 Canvas as it is was meant to be an example of what is possible purely through DOM manipulation.
